I set the engineering rituals — daily 15-min async Discord stand-ups, a written 'definition of done' for PRs (lint pass + manual test + screenshot), and pair-programming sessions for the trickier auth and CORS work.\n\nWe let the frontend start integrating against the Postman contract before the backend was 'finished' — that overlap cut total delivery time by roughly 30%.",
